# Clocktower Timer

This is a custom timer for use with the social deduction game "Blood on the Clocktower".

This is a fork from https://github.com/tydood/clocktowertimer and gets deployed to https://timer.botc-bremen.de/.

Due to some recent changes of the base repository the original version no longer fits the needs of our local group.  
This fork maintains full keyboard shortcuts, overall silence in the app and a somewhat working Spotify integration.
